This code takes multiple lines of text and attempts to pack them into as few length-bounded lines as possible, separated by spaces, using a _very_ naive algorithm.

Thrown together a long time ago very quickly when the need arose for something. Only found out later that this was trying to solve a form of the [bin-packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).

## Usage
1. Paste a bunch of lines of text you want to pack together in the left textarea
2. Click submit and get your results from the right textarea
