Scripts written for [Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/) file manager.

## Quick Checksum
Adds several custom script commands that hash a selected file with a given hash function, then compare the result to a hash in the clipboard. The calculated hash and comparison results are shown in the script log. Intended to be used as new toolbar buttons.

### Ideas for version 2
* Show hash and comparison results in a dialog instead
* Convert the whole thing into a user command
* Better code reuse for different hash functions, less repeating
